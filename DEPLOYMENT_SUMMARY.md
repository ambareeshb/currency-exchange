  - Advanced socket options with TCP keepalive
  - Reduced worker connections (500) to prevent overload
  - Faster timeout detection (60s)
  - Enhanced error handling hooks
  - Broken pipe signal handling
  - Memory and file descriptor monitoring

### 2. Improved Flask Application
- **File**: `app.py`
- **Key Changes**:
  - Socket error filtering and logging
  - Enhanced SocketIO configuration
  - Safe emission functions with error handling
  - Connection state management
  - Graceful disconnection handling

### 3. Advanced Monitoring System
- **Files**: `monitor.sh`, `socket_recovery.py`
- **Features**:
  - Multi-layered socket error detection
  - Process health monitoring
  - Automatic service recovery
  - Resource usage tracking
  - File descriptor leak detection

### 4. Enhanced Deployment
- **File**: `aws-deploy.sh`
- **Improvements**:
  - Systemd service with resource limits
  - Socket recovery service integration
  - Log rotation configuration
  - Enhanced service dependencies

## üìã Deployment Steps

### For Existing Deployments (Update)
```bash
# 1. Connect to your EC2 instance
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-ip

# 2. Navigate to app directory
cd /opt/currency-exchange

# 3. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 4. Run deployment script
./aws-deploy.sh

# 5. Verify deployment
python3 test_socket_fixes.py
```

### For New Deployments
```bash
# 1. Run the enhanced deployment script
./aws-deploy.sh

# 2. The script will automatically:
#    - Install enhanced dependencies
#    - Configure socket recovery services
#    - Set up monitoring and log rotation
#    - Enable all services

# 3. Test the deployment
python3 test_socket_fixes.py
```

## üîç Verification Commands

### Check Service Status
```bash
sudo systemctl status currency-exchange
sudo systemctl status currency-exchange-recovery
sudo systemctl status currency-exchange-recovery.timer
```

### Monitor Socket Errors
```bash
# Real-time monitoring
sudo journalctl -u currency-exchange -f | grep -E "(socket|error|recovery)"

# Check recent socket errors
sudo journalctl -u currency-exchange --since "1 hour ago" | grep -i "bad file descriptor"

# Check handled errors
sudo journalctl -u currency-exchange --since "1 hour ago" | grep "SOCKET_ERROR_HANDLED"
```

### Test Application Health
```bash
# Health endpoint
curl http://localhost/health

# Run comprehensive tests
python3 test_socket_fixes.py

# Monitor resource usage
./monitor.sh
```

## üìä Expected Results

### Before Fix
- Frequent "Bad file descriptor" errors
- Service instability
- Manual restarts required
- Poor error visibility

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Eliminated socket errors
- ‚úÖ Automatic error recovery
- ‚úÖ Intelligent monitoring
- ‚úÖ High availability
- ‚úÖ Resource optimization
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If Socket Errors Persist
1. **Check Recovery Service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status currency-exchange-recovery
   sudo journalctl -u currency-exchange-recovery
   ```

2. **Manual Recovery**:
   ```bash
   python3 socket_recovery.py
   ```

3. **Force Restart**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart currency-exchange
   ```

### Performance Issues
1. **Check Resource Usage**:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep gunicorn
   free -h
   df -h
   ```

2. **Monitor File Descriptors**:
   ```bash
   lsof -p $(pgrep -f "gunicorn.*currency-exchange")
   ```

## üìà Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Watch
- Socket error count (should be 0 or very low)
- Memory usage (should be stable)
- File descriptor count (should not grow continuously)
- Service uptime (should be high)
- Response time (should be consistent)

### Automated Monitoring
- Socket recovery service runs every 30 seconds
- Recovery timer checks every 2 minutes
- Log rotation prevents disk space issues
- Automatic service restart on failures

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Weekly**: Review logs for patterns
2. **Monthly**: Update dependencies
3. **Quarterly**: Performance optimization review

### Automated Tasks
- Log rotation (daily)
- Health checks (continuous)
- Error recovery (automatic)
- Resource monitoring (continuous)

## üìû Support

If issues persist after implementing these fixes:

1. **Check the test results**: `python3 test_socket_fixes.py`
2. **Review the logs**: Focus on handled vs unhandled errors
3. **Monitor resources**: Ensure adequate memory and file descriptors
4. **Verify configuration**: Ensure all services are enabled and running

The enhanced socket error handling system provides a robust, self-healing infrastructure that should eliminate the "Bad file descriptor" errors while maintaining high performance and availability.
